	<p><pre>⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡ Day 3</pre></p>
	<p>Today we took a day trip to Kamakura by train. Kamakura is a beach town known for its Buddhist Temples. </p>
	<p>To be honest, I was not able to properly enjoy the sights or take pictures because it was very hot and my feet were aching.</p>
	<p>I spotted these cats while walking and they made me happy.</p>

	<p>Eventually I found a cafe where I ate delicious curry with cheese and rice.</p>

	<p>However I am lactose-intolerant and suffered even more for the rest of the day.</p>
	<p>Kamakura was very beautiful and walking along the beach boardwalk is enjoyable. However the amount of tourists and visitors is overwhelming for such a small town. The trains are overcrowded and impossible to even fit on at times.</p>
