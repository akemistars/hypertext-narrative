	<h1>Alice's Trip to Japan</h1>
	<p><pre>⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡ Day 1</pre></p>
	<p>I landed in Japan today, and immediately made my way to Shibuya.
	<p>Shibuya is known for the famous crossing which I traversed.<p>

	<p>Afterwards, I headed to the famous Shibuya PARCO mall, home to the Nintendo Store on their highest floor along with other flagships.</p>
	<p>My brother tried on this very flattering sweater.</p>
