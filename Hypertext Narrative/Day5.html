	<h1>Alice's Trip to Japan</h1>
	<p><pre>⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡ Day 5</pre></p>
	<p>I visited the Ghibli Museum today, which was very hard to secure reservations for.
	<p>The outside and structure was so cool. <p>

	<p>Pictures were not allowed inside, so I had to secretly take a few.</p>
	<p>I saw concept art of characters from my favorite Studio Ghibli movie, Howl's Moving Castle.</p>

	<p>We also saw a special viewing of a short film set after the Totoro Universe.</p>
	<p>Today was Day 5: Shibuya Crossing. To view the past days, refer to the link below.
