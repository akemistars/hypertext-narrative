	<p><pre>⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡ Day 2</pre></p>
	<p>Today I traveled to my favorite place in the world, <span style="color:red">Chiikawa Land.</span></p>
	<p>I was immediately greeted by the sight of the smiling characters.</p>

	<p>The shop was filled with various merchandise of Chiikawa characters.</p>
	<p>Finding Chiikawa merch or items in the U.S. is rare and expensive, so I have to buy here while I still can.</p>
	<p>Here I bought a limited-edition Chiikawa x Converse collab shoes. I still wear them today.</p>
	<p>Look at how happy I am!</p>
